# Whatever this script prints to STDOUT is injected into Claude's context at the
# start of every session/resume. This is the "doesn't rely on Claude remembering"
# mechanism: memory is loaded automatically, every time.
#
# Input: JSON on stdin (session_id, cwd, source, ...). We don't need it, but read it
# so the pipe doesn't break.
#
# Keep this FAST (it runs on every session). Output is plain text/markdown.
